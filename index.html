  <em> What is the web? </em>
  <br>
  The web is a collection of computers that are connected to each other. Some of this computers are what we call <b> servers </b>. These servers store the <b> HTML documents </b>, which are the documents that glues text, images and videos displayed on a website.  
  <br>
</p>
<p>
  <em> How does users access to content on different websites? </em>
  <br>Websites are comprised of HTML documents. Users access to websites in the internet through their browsers. The computer uses HTTP protocol to ask the appropiate servers in the internet to send the HTML document of the URL the user has indicated. The browser is then in charged of reading, interpreting and displaying the HTML document.   
</P>
<p>
  <b>HTML</b>
  <br>
HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. HTML documents contain text content which describes "what you see" and markup which describes "how it looks". 

<b>Tags and Elements</b>
HTML documents are made of HTML elements. When writing HTML, we tell browsers the type of each element by using HTML tags. 
  <br>
  <br>
  For example, <b><em> I just used two tags to make this senntece bold and italic</b></em>
  <br>
  <br>
  Another example of a Tag and an element is this <a href="www.hipmunk.com"> link</a> to Hipmunk.

<p>
  <b>Inline vs Block Elements</b>
HTML elements are either inline or block. Block elements form a "invisible box" around the content inside of them.
